<h1 style="color:black">Features of java</h1>
</div>

<p style="font-size:20px;">Following are the notable features of Java:</p>
<p style="font-size:20px";><B>Object Oriented</B></p>

<p>In Java, everything is an Object.</p>
<p>Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.</p><br>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Platform Independent</B></p>
<p>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code.</p><p> This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Simple</B></p>
<p>Java is designed to be easy to learn.</p><p> If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Secure</B></p>
<p>With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. </p><p>Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</p>


<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Portable</B></p>
<p>Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable.</p><p> The compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Robust</B></p>
<p>Java makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Multithreaded</B></p>
<p>With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously.</p><p> This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Interpreted</B></p>
<p>Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. </p><p>The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>High Performance</B></p>
<p>With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><b>Distributed</b></p>
<p>Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;"><B>Dynamic</B></p>
<p>Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment.</p><p> Java programs can carry an extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at run-time</p>
